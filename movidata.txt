What is Docker?
	Docker is an open platform for developing, shipping and running applications.

	Docker enables you to separate your applications from your infra so you can deliver software quickly. 
	
	With docker, you can manage your infra in the same way as you manage your applications. 
	
	By taking advantage of Docker's methodologies for shipping, testing and deploying code quickly, you can significantly reduce the delay between writing code and running it in production.
	
Docker Platform
	- Docker provides the abilitiy to package and run an application in a loosely isolated environment called a container.
	
	- The isolation and security allows you to run many containers simultaneously on a given host. 
	
	- Containers are lightweight and contain everything needed to run the application, so you don't need to rely on what is currently installed on the host.
	
	- You can easily share containers while you work, and be sure that everyone you share with gets the same container that works in the same way.
	
Docker provides tooling and a platform to manage the lifecycle of your contianers.
	
	- Develop your application and its supporting components using containers.
	
	- The container becomes the unit for distributing and testing your application. 
	
	- When you're ready, deploy your application into your production environment, as a container or an orchestrated service.
	
	- This works the same whether your production environment is local data center, a cloud provider or hybrid of two.
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	
	

Docker Swarm
	- Docker Swarm is a container orchestration tool, meaning that it allows the user to manage multiple containers deployed across multiple host machines.
	
	- One of the key benifits associated with the operation of a docker swarm is the high level of availability offered for applications.
	
	- Docker Swarm is an open-source container orchestration platform built and maintained by Docker. Under the hood, Docker Swarm converts multiple Docker instance into a single virtual host. A Docker Swarm cluster generally contains three items.
		Nodes
		Services and Tasks
		Load Balancers

Nodes are individual instances of the Docker Engine that control your cluster and manage the containers used to run your services and tasks. 

Docker Swarm cluster also includes load balancing route requests across nodes.

Compliance
http://192.168.1.25/Compliance_Audit/1_Compliance_Audit_Introduction.txt

Compliance Audit

There are two words 

1. Compliance
2. Audit. 


1. Compliance

The word Compliance is derived from the Latin word "Complere"
which means (having all parts or elements; lacking nothing)

The word complete is also derived from the same word "Complere"

Compliance consists of being amenable (happy to accept Something), being obedient(Aagnakari) to the other party, and fully meeting demands.

 
In a legal context, this means to obey legal orders and fully realize the rule of law

Rule of Law (The law is applied equally and fairly)





No one is above the law. (Even the king is bind to the law)
Law is KING. ..










2. Audit


- An audit involves being independent.
- Audits are impartial and intended to look at what the organisation has done and make sure that itâ€(tm)s in line with what they said they did.






- Effectively an audit function monitors and evaluates how effectively and efficiently the business has met its own internal control policies, processes and procedures.




- It ensures that the policies, processes and procedures of the business are being followed correctly and identifies opportunities for the business to manage its risks.

- Essentially, the audit function gives the business assurance that its intentions are being followed through.


-A key part of auditâ€(tm)s role is looking back at what the organisation has done and identifying where this may need to change in the future.



Compliance vs Audit


While compliance and audit are like two sides of the same coin, they play very different roles. 

While audit may monitor what the organisation is doing and find deficiencies in a companyâ€(tm)s policies, processes and procedures, it may not identify whether the organisation has actually complied with its legal obligations. 

However, compliance will look at a policy, process and procedure from the lens of regulatory compliance. Does it meet legal obligations? Are laws being followed? Can the organisation meet its regulatory obligations?
